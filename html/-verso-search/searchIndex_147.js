No requirements are imposed on the type of elements, except for some operators\nthat require decidable equality.\n\nThe demonstration has three parts:\n\n1. First, an equivalence relation that equates any two lists with the same elements is defined.2. Next, various operations on lists are shown to preserve this relation.3. Finally, lists are quotiented by the relation, and set operations are defined using list\n    operations.\n\nIn practice, this is a poor representation, because unsorted linked lists full of duplicates are not\nan efficient data structure.\n\n\n","context":"","header":"DemoTextbook.ListSet","id":"/DemoTextbook/ListSet/#mod-doc-DemoTextbook___ListSet-2-0"}});
