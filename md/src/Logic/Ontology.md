 # REAL WORLD KNOWLEDGE

# ONTOLOGIES

Def: Ontololgy. A set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them.

  Concepts of interest:

  - Events
  - Time
  - Physical Objects
  - Beliefs

Example of a Extensible `Upper ontology` (RN p 315)

Goal: Represent all of this with FOL, even though FOL is fairly limited for representing real world knowledge. For example,

  ∀ x , Tomato(x) → Red(x)

is not always true. Listing all the exceptions to a rule is challenging. For now, we'll gloss over this. Later we'll talk about how to represent `uncertainty`.

`Special Purpose Ontology`: Covers a particular domain, like "automobiles" or "birds."

`General Purpose Ontology`: Includes all of human knowledge. Has to not only contain all specialzed domains, it also needs to use a consistent language and representation across all domains so that inter-domain reasoning does not break down.

Examples:

  `CYC` and `OPENCYC` are built bottom up by logicians.

  `DBPedia` scrapes Wikipedia to generate an ontology.

  `TextRunner` was built from scraping the web.

  `OpenMind` built by untrained volunteers answering questions.

Contemporary Example

  `Google Knolwedge Graph` comes from Wikipedia and curated knowledge from the web.
  https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph

You can go to the web page above and search for "Taylor Swift". Among other bits of information, Google will return

        ...
        "@id": "kg:/m/0dl567",
        "name": "Taylor Swift",
        "@type": [
          "Thing",
          "Person"
        ],
        "description": "Singer-songwriter",
        ...

Good to know!



# CATEGORIES AND OBJECTS

To reason about objects, doing so at the level of categories of objects is prefered. For example, we might want to state a property about all basketballs or all balls, rather than about each specific ball. Some basic definitions are in order. Note that these are inspired by Mathlib's Set library in which a Set is just a predicate. Here we'll use the word `category` to be consistent with Russel and Norvig. This use should not be confused with the mathematical notion of a category. 
```lean
def Category (α : Type u) := α → Prop
```
 Now we can introduce categories and state that an object is in a category. 
```lean
variable (base : Type u)
         (b : base)
         (Basketball: Category base)
         (m1 : Basketball b)
```
 We can express what it means to be a sub-category. 
```lean
def Subcategory {α : Type} (A : Category α) (B : Category α) :=
  ∀ x : α , A x → B x
```
 Now we can do a simple example. 
```lean
example (Object : Type) (b : Object) (Basketball Ball: Category Object) :
  Basketball b ∧ Subcategory Basketball Ball → Ball b := by
  intro ⟨ h1, h2 ⟩
  apply (h2 b) h1
```
 This is fine. But what happens when the amount of information in our knowledge base becomes large, with thousands of rules? To prove theorems we would need to state every single bit of information as a hypothesis.

Lean provides a more scalable way to proceed by defining variables that form the context of every proof that comes after their declarations. Here is an initial attempt at doing so. All of these rule properties would go in a (large) file somewhere. The addition of the NumericalFunction type allows us to write all of the statements in the first section of Russel and Norvig's chapter on knowledge representation. 
```lean
def NumericalFunction (α : Type u) := α → Float

variable (base : Type u)
         (b c : base)
         (Basketball Ball Spherical Orange Round: Category base)
         (Diameter : NumericalFunction base)
         (m1 : Basketball b)
         (s1 : Subcategory Basketball Ball)
         (s2 : Subcategory Ball Spherical)
         (s3 : Subcategory Basketball Orange)
         (f1 : ∀ x, Basketball x → Diameter x = 9.5)
         (r1 : ∀ x, Orange x ∧ Round x ∧ Diameter x = 9.5 ∧ Ball x → Basketball x)
```
 Now we do not have to list every but of knowledge when stating theorems. All variables are implicitly included as assumptions. Lean's "apply?" method can even figure out how to prove simple things. 
```lean
example : Ball b := s1 b m1
example : Spherical b := s2 b (s1 b m1)
example : Orange b := s3 b m1
```
 # CATEGORIES OF CATEGORIES

Another relationship found in ontologies is the notion that an entire category can be a member of a sort of meta category. For example, 
```lean
def MetaCategory (α : Type u) := Category α → Prop

variable (DomesticatedSpecies Animals: MetaCategory base)
         (Dogs Cats: Category base)
         (c1 : DomesticatedSpecies Dogs)
         (c2 : DomesticatedSpecies Cats)
         (s4 : Subcategory DomesticatedSpecies Animals)
```
 These types of relationships would allow you to reason at a meta level about categories. An infinite heirarchy of categories is essentially what Lean's type system allows, suggesting how this might be used. 
 # DISJOINT PAIR

Knowledge bases often describe what objects are not. One way to do this is to add a requirement that two categories have no objects in common.


```lean
def DisjointPair {α : Type u} (A: Category α) (B: Category α) :=
  ∀ x : α , (A x → ¬B x) ∧ (B x → ¬A x)

variable (Animal Vegetable : Category base)
         (d1: DisjointPair Animal Vegetable)

example (x : base) : Animal x → ¬ Vegetable x := by
  intro h
  have ⟨ hl, _ ⟩ := d1 x
  apply hl h
```
 # DISJOINT LIST

You might describe a fully disjoint list of categories. Here, we use Lean's `List` type.


```lean
def Disjoint {α : Type u} (parts : List (Category α)) :=
  List.Pairwise DisjointPair parts

variable (Mineral : Category base)
         (d2: Disjoint [Animal, Vegetable, Mineral])

example (x : base): Animal x → ¬ Vegetable x ∧ ¬ Mineral x := by
  intro h
  have h0 := d2
  simp[Disjoint, DisjointPair] at h0
  have ⟨ ⟨ h1, h2 ⟩, _ ⟩ := h0
  have ⟨ h4, _ ⟩ := h1 x
  have h5 := h4 h
  have ⟨ h6, _ ⟩ := h2 x
  have h7 := h6 h
  apply And.intro h5 h7


-- A condensed proof
example : ∀ (x : base) , Animal x → ¬ Vegetable x ∧ ¬ Mineral x := by
  intro x h
  simp[Disjoint] at d2
  exact ⟨ (d2.left.left x).left h, (d2.left.right x).left h ⟩
```
 # EXHAUSTIVE CATEGORIES

Prescribing an exhastive set of categories disallows an object from not belonging to *some* category. The defintion does not require that an object is in only one category. In the example below, one might have a dual citizenship.


 A helper function that returns whether P is true for some object in a list L. 
```lean
def exists_in_list {α : Type u} (L : List α) (P: α → Prop) := match L with
  | [] => False
  | h :: t => P h ∨ exists_in_list t P

def ExhaustiveDecomposition {α : Type u} (parts : List (Category α)) (whole: Category α) :=
  ∀ (x : α) , (whole x) ↔ (exists_in_list parts (λ p => p x))

variable
  (American Canadian Mexican NorthAmerican : Category base)
  (ed1 : ExhaustiveDecomposition [American, Canadian, Mexican] NorthAmerican)

example (x : base) :   NorthAmerican x
                   ∧ ¬ Canadian x
                   ∧ ¬ Mexican x → American x:= by
  intro ⟨ h, hs, hl ⟩
  have h0 := (ed1 x).mp h
  iterate 4 rw[exists_in_list] at h0
  simp[*] at h0
  exact h0
```
 # PARTITIONS

A partition is a set of categories that is disjoint and exhaustive.


```lean
def Partition {α : Type u} (parts : List (Category α)) (whole: Category α) :=
  ExhaustiveDecomposition parts whole ∧ Disjoint parts

variable (Student UG Masters PHD : Category base)
variable (p1 : Partition [UG, Masters, PHD] Student)
```
 This next example dones't use the disjoint part 
```lean
example (x : base) : Student x ∧ ¬ UG x ∧ ¬ Masters x → PHD x := by
  intro ⟨ hs, hug, hms ⟩
  have h0 := (p1.left x).mp hs
  simp[exists_in_list] at h0
  cases h0 with
  | inl h2 => exact False.elim (hug h2)
  | inr h3 => cases h3 with
    | inl h4 => exact False.elim (hms h4)
    | inr h5 => exact h5

#check not_or_intro
```
 This example doesn't use the exhaustive part.  
```lean
example (x : base) : PHD x → ¬(UG x ∨ Masters x) := by
  intro h
  have h1 := p1.right
  simp[Disjoint,DisjointPair] at h1
  have ⟨ ⟨ _, g2 ⟩, g3 ⟩ := h1
  exact not_or_intro ((g2 x).right h) ((g3 x).right h)
```
 This part uses the reverse of the condition in Exhaustive Decomposition 
```lean
example (x : base) : PHD x → Student x := by
  intro h
  have h0 := (p1.left x).mpr
  simp[exists_in_list] at h0
  exact h0 (Or.inr (Or.inr h))
```
 # DEFINITIONS

One can simply state that an object is in a category, or one can define what the category is by relating it to other categories. Here's an example.


```lean
variable (Bachelor Unmarried Adult Male : Category base)
         (def_bachelor : ∀ (x:base), Bachelor x ↔ Unmarried x ∧ Adult x ∧ Male x)

example : ∀ (x:base) , Bachelor x → Male x := by
  intro x h
  have ⟨ _, _, hm ⟩ := (def_bachelor x).mp h
  exact hm
```
 # PHYSICAL COMPOSITION 
```lean
def Relation (α : Type u) := α → α → Prop
def Reflexive (r : Relation α)  := ∀ a : α , r a a
def Transitive {α : Type u} (r : Relation α) :=
  ∀ x y z , r x y → r y z → r x z

variable (PartOf : Relation base)
         (part_of_refl  : Reflexive PartOf)
         (part_of_trans : Transitive PartOf)

variable (Bucharest Romania EasternEurope Europe Earth : base)
         (pbr : PartOf Bucharest Romania)
         (pree : PartOf Romania EasternEurope)
         (peee : PartOf EasternEurope Europe)
         (pee : PartOf Europe Earth)

example : PartOf Bucharest Earth := by
  have h1 := part_of_trans Bucharest Romania EasternEurope
  have h2 := part_of_trans Bucharest EasternEurope Europe
  have h3 := part_of_trans Bucharest Europe Earth
  exact h3 (h2 (h1 pbr pree) peee) pee
```
 # CHARACTERIZING OBJECTS BY HOW THEY ARE CONSTRUCTED

Below we state that if an animal is a biped, then it has exactly two legs that are attached to its body.

 
```lean
variable (Leg Body Biped : Category base)
         (Attached : Relation base)
         (attached_refl : Reflexive Attached)

variable (is_biped : ∀ a , Biped a →
  ∃ l₁ l₂ b , Leg l₁ ∧ Leg l₂ ∧ Body b ∧
              PartOf l₁ a ∧ PartOf l₂ a ∧ PartOf b a ∧
              Attached l₁ b ∧ Attached l₂ b ∧
              l₁ ≠ l₂ ∧
              ∀ l₃ , Leg l₃ ∧ PartOf l₃ a → (l₃ = l₁ ∨ l₃ = l₂))
```
